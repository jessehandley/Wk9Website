      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to attract new customers to Whitewater Rafting Company, and to create a more user-friendly experience 
        for our existing customers. Functionally, customers will use this site to learn more about the area, really get a taste of Colorado,
        and be able to sign up for expeditions online. We would like to see a short story about our company on the about page, lots of pictures
        of the river and local wildlife, perhaps some history of the area. testimonials should also be featured. The whole of the website
        should be engaging, modern, and showcase the trademark Whitewater experience we provide.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We serve a variety of age groups, from young vacationing families to retired elders, but our primary target audience for this website
        is college students ages 18 - 30 looking for an excursion to recharge during summer break. While keeping our wide audience in mind,
        focus on reaching these students by designing a website that
        is inviting, relaxing, and exciting. Remember, they want a break, so keep paragraphs short and to the point. Incorporate a lot of visual
        elements. Make it modern and fun, count to a textbook. They will access the site with a variety of devices, so a responsive layout is imperative.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- You are not required to use this logo for your site…but you must have a logo for your website.  I can offer additional logos to use, or you can create your own-->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/14374d-396cab-fffbfe-978263-624d38" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/14374d-396cab-fffbfe-978263-624d38</a></p>

        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#396CAB</td><td class="secondary">#14374D</td><td class="base">#FFFBFE</td><td class="accent1">#978263</td><td class="accent2">#624d38</td></tr>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Roboto Slab Bold <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Roboto Slab Bold matches the main title on the company logo. Using it as heading font throughout
        the website will help maintain branding and feel.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Raleway <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Raleway is a simple, attractive sans-serif font that provides easy screen reading as well as 
        good contrast to the heading font I have selected. I opted for just a touch of letter 
        spacing for easier readability on the screen.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
